## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- React Query only (no localStorage/server cache): Simplicity for pet project, historical data is immutable so in-memory cache with staleTime: Infinity is sufficient
- Client-side data fetching only: No backend needed, APIs are public and free, reduces infrastructure complexity
- Dark minimalist design (not F1 branded): Portfolio piece needs clean and professional look, team colors for data viz only
- shadcn/ui over other component libraries: Copy-paste components, full control, works well with Tailwind, good dark theme support
