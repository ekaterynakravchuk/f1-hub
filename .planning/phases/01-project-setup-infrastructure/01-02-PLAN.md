<objective>
Build the landing page UI with responsive navigation, module cards, and disclaimer footer.

Purpose: Deliver the user-facing outcome of Phase 1 -- a styled dark-themed landing page where users can see available F1 modules and navigate to them. This is the first thing users see.

Output: Complete landing page with navigation, module cards, footer, and route stubs for Head-to-Head and Quiz modules.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create responsive navigation and disclaimer footer</name>
  <files>
    components/layout/navigation.tsx
    components/layout/footer.tsx
    app/layout.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Create `components/layout/navigation.tsx`:
       - Mark "use client" (uses useState for mobile menu toggle)
       - Import Link from next/link (not anchor tags -- enables client-side navigation)
       - Import Button from @/components/ui/button for mobile menu toggle
       - Define nav links array: Home (/), Head-to-Head (/head-to-head), Quiz (/quiz)
         NOTE: Only include modules planned for v1.0 (Head-to-Head and Quiz). Do NOT add Radio, History, Weather, Telemetry, or Strategy -- those are v1.1+.
       - Desktop nav (hidden md:flex): Logo text "F1 Hub" on left (bold, text-lg), links on right in a row with gap-6, muted text that highlights on hover
       - Mobile nav (md:hidden): Logo text "F1 Hub" on left, hamburger button on right. When toggled, show links vertically below the header bar. Use a simple hamburger icon (3 horizontal lines SVG). Clicking a link closes the menu.
       - Use border-b on nav for subtle bottom border
       - Container with mx-auto and px-4 for consistent width
       - Style: neutral/muted colors for links, text-foreground on hover. Keep it minimal -- no background colors on nav, just border-b for separation.

    2. Create `components/layout/footer.tsx`:
       - Server Component (no "use client" needed -- purely static)
       - Render: "Unofficial, not affiliated with Formula 1" (exact text per INFRA-05)
       - Style: border-t for top border, text-sm, text-muted-foreground, text-center, py-6
       - Container with mx-auto and px-4
       - Add mt-auto so footer sticks to bottom when content is short (requires flex flex-col on body/main wrapper)

    3. Update `app/layout.tsx` (created in Plan 01):
       - Import Navigation from @/components/layout/navigation
       - Import Footer from @/components/layout/footer
       - Add Navigation component at the top of body content (above {children})
       - Wrap {children} in a `<main className="flex-1">` tag
       - Add Footer component at the bottom of body content (below main)
       - The body should already have flex flex-col min-h-screen from Plan 01 -- verify this is present so footer sticks to bottom
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run build` -- must pass. Run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:3000. Verify: navigation bar visible at top with "F1 Hub" and links, footer visible at bottom with disclaimer text, dark background throughout.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Navigation renders at top with desktop layout (logo + links) and mobile layout (logo + hamburger). Footer renders at bottom with exact disclaimer text "Unofficial, not affiliated with Formula 1". Both are wired into root layout.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Create landing page with module cards and route stubs</name>
  <files>
    app/page.tsx
    app/head-to-head/page.tsx
    app/quiz/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Replace `app/page.tsx` with the landing page:
       - Server Component (no "use client" -- static content)
       - Import Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription from @/components/ui/card
       - Import Link from next/link
       - Hero section at top: "F1 Hub" as large heading (text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold), subtitle "Explore Formula 1 data and statistics" in text-muted-foreground (text-lg md:text-xl), centered, generous top padding (py-16 md:py-24)
       - Module cards section: Define an array of modules with name, description, href, and status:
         ```
         { name: "Head-to-Head", description: "Compare any two F1 drivers side-by-side with statistics and interactive charts", href: "/head-to-head", status: "Coming Soon" }
         { name: "Quiz", description: "Test your Formula 1 knowledge with procedurally generated questions", href: "/quiz", status: "Coming Soon" }
         { name: "Team Radio", description: "Browse and listen to team radio communications", href: "#", status: "Planned" }
         { name: "History", description: "Explore an interactive timeline of Formula 1 history", href: "#", status: "Planned" }
         { name: "Weather Impact", description: "Analyze how weather conditions affect race outcomes", href: "#", status: "Planned" }
         { name: "Telemetry", description: "Visualize car telemetry data and compare driver performance", href: "#", status: "Planned" }
         { name: "Strategy Simulator", description: "Simulate pit stop strategies and race scenarios", href: "#", status: "Planned" }
         ```
       - Render cards in a responsive grid: grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6
       - Each card: wrapped in Link (only if href is not "#"), shows module name as CardTitle, description as CardDescription, and status as a small badge/text at top-right or bottom of card
       - Cards with href="#" should NOT be wrapped in Link -- render as plain Card with reduced opacity (opacity-60) to indicate they're not yet available
       - Active cards (Coming Soon): hover:bg-accent/50 transition-colors cursor-pointer
       - Container: max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4
       - Per user decision: dark minimalist design -- generous whitespace, clean typography, no flashy colors

    2. Create `app/head-to-head/page.tsx`:
       - Simple placeholder page (Server Component)
       - Heading: "Head-to-Head"
       - Subtitle: "Compare any two F1 drivers side-by-side"
       - Text: "Coming in Phase 4" in muted text
       - Link back to home
       - Container with padding matching landing page

    3. Create `app/quiz/page.tsx`:
       - Simple placeholder page (Server Component)
       - Heading: "Quiz"
       - Subtitle: "Test your Formula 1 knowledge"
       - Text: "Coming soon" in muted text
       - Link back to home
       - Container with padding matching landing page

    IMPORTANT: Use Next.js Link component (not anchor tags) for all internal navigation. Only use href="#" for modules that don't have routes yet.

    Run `npm run build` -- must pass (confirms all routes resolve, no broken imports). Visit http://localhost:3000 and verify: 7 module cards visible in grid, Head-to-Head and Quiz cards are clickable, other cards are visually dimmed. Click Head-to-Head card -- navigates to /head-to-head with placeholder content. Click Quiz card -- navigates to /quiz. Click browser back -- returns to landing page. Verify navigation links also work.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Landing page displays 7 module cards in responsive grid. Head-to-Head and Quiz are linked and navigable. Remaining 5 modules show as "Planned" with dimmed styling. All routes build without errors.
